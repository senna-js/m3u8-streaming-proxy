# Streaming Proxy Server

A Node.js application to proxy and rewrite `.m3u8` streaming URLs with **caching**, **origin lock**, **rate limiting**, **logging**, and **Docker support**.
---

## Features
- **Caching**: Responses are cached in memory to reduce repeated requests to the origin server.
- **Origin Lock**: Restrict access to the proxy by allowing requests only from specific origins.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP.
- **Logging**: Log HTTP requests for monitoring and debugging.
- **Security Headers**: Protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Docker Support**: Easily deploy the application using Docker.
- **Health Check**: Monitor the application's status.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web server framework.
- **hls.js**: JavaScript library for playing HLS streams in browsers.
- **node-fetch**: Fetch API for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.

     PORT=3000
     ```

4. **Start the Server**
   - For development (with auto-restart):
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For production:

## **Usage**

### **1. Proxy Endpoint**
- Make a GET request to the proxy endpoint with the `url` query parameter:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/streamingProxy?url=<your-m3u8-url>
  ```

- Example:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/streamingProxy?url=https://example.com/stream/playlist.m3u8
  ```

### **2. Test with the HTML Page**
- Open the HTML page at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Enter a `.m3u8` URL in the input field and click "Load Stream".
- The video will load and play in the video player.
